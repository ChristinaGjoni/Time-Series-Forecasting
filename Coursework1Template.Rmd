# 🔮 Introduction: Forecasting our Future with Prophet

Every day, we make predictions on what to wear (I can definitely
relate!) based on the weather. What if we could **predict real-world
trends** with data? Which is what we will delve into!

### **Objectives of This Report 📌**

✔️ **Get a sense of CO2 levels over time** 

✔️ **Use Prophet to forecast
future values** 

✔️ **Graph trends** 

✔️ **Draw conclusions about
long-term trends**

### 1.1 Let's get our data ready! 📊

Before we are able to begin predicting, we must **correctly format our
data for use in Prophet.** The default **CO2 dataset** available in R
provides us with monthly observations from **1959 onward.** We will
**change it to a form that can be interpreted by Prophet.**

```{r}
# Load the required libraries
library(zoo)
# Rearrange built-in CO2 dataset to a Prophet-acceptable form
co2_df <- data.frame(
ds = zoo::as.yearmon(time(co2)), # Reshape time into Year-Month form
y <- as.numeric(co2) # Convert values to numeric
)
# Print the first few rows of the dataset
head(co2_df)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(astsa)
start(ENSO)
end(ENSO)
frequency(ENSO)
```

### 1.2 Now lets train The Forecast Model🧮

Now that our dataset is correctly formatted, we can train the
forecasting model. 👉 What the code does: ✅ Loads the prophet package
✅ Trains the Prophet model using co2_df ✅ Generates a future dataframe
(8 months ahead) for predictions ✅ Prints out future time periods to
confirm structure

```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(zoo)
library(prophet)

# Convert CO2 dataset into a Prophet-compatible format
co2_df <- data.frame(
  ds = zoo::as.yearmon(time(co2)),  # Convert time to Year-Month format
  y = as.numeric(co2)  # Convert values to numeric
)

# Correct column names
colnames(co2_df) <- c("ds", "y")

# Print structure
str(co2_df)

# Print first few rows
head(co2_df)

# Train the Prophet model
m <- prophet(co2_df)

# Create a dataframe for future predictions (8 months ahead)
future <- make_future_dataframe(m, periods = 8, freq = "month")

# Display the first few rows of future dates
head(future)
```

### 1.3 Let's Visualise the Forecast!📈

Now that we have been able to train our Prophet model, let's get to
visualizing the predicted CO2 levels! This part will make plots to
enable us to observe the patterns and trends the model is forecasting.✨

```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(zoo)
library(prophet)

# Convert CO2 dataset into a Prophet-compatible format
co2_df <- data.frame(
  ds = zoo::as.yearmon(time(co2)),  # Convert time to Year-Month format
  y = as.numeric(co2)  # Convert values to numeric
)

# Correct column names
colnames(co2_df) <- c("ds", "y")

# Train the Prophet model
model <- prophet(co2_df)

# Create a dataframe for future predictions (8 months ahead)
future <- make_future_dataframe(model, periods = 8, freq = "month")

# Check if future dataframe has data
head(future)

# Generate predictions
forecast <- predict(model, future)

# Check if forecast was generated
head(forecast)

# Plot the forecast
plot(model, forecast)

# Visualise forecast components (trend, seasonality)
prophet_plot_components(model, forecast)

```

### 1.4 Analyse the Forecast! 📌

✔️ The cumulative CO2 concentrations are increasing, showing a trend of
increase with time. 

✔️ The confidence intervals (yhat_lower and yhat_upper) indicate potential variations in forecasts, i.e., there is some uncertainty in the future predictions of the model.

✔️ There can be seasonality, where CO2 can increase and decrease in a periodic manner due to annual trends.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Summary statistics of the forecast
summary(forecast)

# Extract key forecasted values
tail(forecast[, c("ds", "yhat", "yhat_lower", "yhat_upper")])
```

# The Conclusion 🚀

Our journey through CO₂ forecasting with Prophet has been both insightful and eye-opening! By averaging historical CO₂ data dating back to 1959, we’ve successfully built a predictive model that highlights key trends in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.

**Key Takeaways:**

✅ Steady Increase in CO₂ Levels
Our forecast reinforces what has been observed for a long time by climate scientists—CO₂ level is increasing steadily over the years. This is corroborated by real observations from NASA and NOAA, highlighting the gravity of climate observation.

✅ Seasonal Trends & Annual Variations
Prophet was capable of detecting seasonal variations in CO₂ levels, which could be explained by natural cycles in nature, such as absorption by plants during certain times of the year and increased emissions during winter.

It's not just numbers, it's a direct reflection of how our planet is changing. With data science and forecasting models like Prophet, we can use data to support climate change efforts, making data-driven decisions that help mitigate risks, drive solutions, and inform meaningful action. If data can make us predict the future, maybe we can change it.❤️

NASA measures CO₂ concentration and climate patterns from satellite data. It provides very pleasant visualisations and information about CO₂ trends in the long-run.
